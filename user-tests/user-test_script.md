# Test protocole
This protocole aim to mesure differents parameters, objectives and subjectives to define the potential of usability by new users.
First, it will mesure the efficiency and reliability of our prototype for remote desktop control.
And then, the test will switch on qualitatives questions in order to explicit by words, feelings, how our prototype is embeeded in normal behaviors.
